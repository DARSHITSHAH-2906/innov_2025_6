The roots are thin and cylindrical. In different regions of India, various plants are known as Shankhpushpi, including Evolvulus alsinoides, Clitoria ternatea, and Canscora decussata, but Convolvulus pluricaulis is considered the true Shankhpushpi in classical Ayurvedic texts. The name comes from Sanskrit 'shankha' (conch shell) and 'pushpi' (flower), referring to the shape of its flowers. It's been used in Ayurvedic medicine for thousands of years as a 'medhya rasayana' (brain and memory tonic).",

Leaves are trifoliate, alternate, with leaflets 4-10 cm long, ovate-lanceolate with crenate margins. Flowers are greenish-white, sweet-scented, appearing in lateral panicles. The fruit is the most distinctive feature - a large, spherical to oval berry, 5-15 cm in diameter, with a hard, woody shell. The interior contains a yellow-orange, aromatic pulp with numerous seeds embedded in it. The pulp is sweet, resinous, and astringent. The Sanskrit name 'Bilva' is mentioned in several ancient texts, including the Rigveda and Yajurveda. The tree is considered sacred in Hinduism and is especially associated with Lord Shiva. The trifoliate leaf symbolizes the three aspects of divinity (creation, preservation, and destruction) or the three eyes of Shiva. In Ayurveda, bael is classified as having 'tridoshic' properties, meaning it can balance all three doshas (vata, pitta, and kapha).",

            "description": "Pippali is a slender, aromatic climber with small, spike-like fruits. It’s a key spice and medicine in Ayurveda, known for its digestive and respiratory benefits. The plant has heart-shaped leaves, 5-10 cm long, and climbs up to 2-3 meters with the support of trees or trellises. The fruits are small, cylindrical spikes, 2-5 cm long, green when unripe, turning black when dried. The Sanskrit name 'Pippali' means 'pepper', reflecting its pungent taste and relation to black pepper (Piper nigrum). It’s also called 'Maghi' in some texts, meaning 'long'. Pippali is cultivated for both its dried fruits and roots, which are used medicinally.",

            "medical_description": "Pippali contains piperine and piperlongumine, which contribute to its digestive and bioavailability-enhancing properties. Clinical studies confirm its efficacy in improving gastric secretion and intestinal motility, supporting its use in dyspepsia and IBS. Research demonstrates significant bronchodilatory and expectorant effects, reducing airway inflammation and mucus in asthma and bronchitis. Studies show pippali enhances the bioavailability of other drugs and nutrients through inhibition of P-glycoprotein and CYP3A4 enzymes. Its anti-inflammatory effects operate through inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokines and NF-κB pathways. Research indicates immunomodulatory properties through enhanced macrophage activity. Studies suggest potential hepatoprotective effects through antioxidant mechanisms. Recent research explores its anti-cancer potential through induction of apoptosis in certain cancer cell lines.",

For stem cuttings, select healthy stems 15-20 cm long with 2-3 nodes, plant in moist soil with support, and keep shaded until rooted. For seed propagation, sow seeds 0.5 cm deep in nursery beds; germination occurs within 2-3 weeks. Transplant when seedlings reach 15-20 cm height, spacing plants 60-90 cm apart with trellises. Water regularly to maintain soil moisture. Apply organic compost annually. Harvest fruits when they turn dark green, typically 6-8 months after planting, and dry in shade. For medicinal use, fruits and roots are collected and dried for 7-10 days.",
